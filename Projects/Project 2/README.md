## Instructions

This project consists of three files:
1- index.html
2- styles.css
3- app.js
index.html has main elements inside while the most of the content comes from js.app dynamically.

The main purpose of this project is to check how many sections on the page and add them automatically on the navigation bar as links so it will be easy to navigate to them through nav bar. Also, it will calculate which section is currently viewed and highlight it and it's nav bar so it will be shown which section is being read.

I've added an extra function as well where you don't have to add new section in index.html file to check the code, but add as many as new sections as you want directly from the page by clicking on Add section button n the top.
